    text: "What was the root cause of the most recent incident that affected the server running Project Aurora?"
    expected_answer: >
      Project Aurora runs on prod-api-03. The most recent incident affecting
      that server was INC-2025-042, a P1 network partition in the Portland
      datacenter caused by a firmware bug in the top-of-rack switch
      (Arista 7280R3) that triggered a spanning tree reconvergence event.

    text: "What SLA tier applies to datacenters in the us-west region, and what is its uptime guarantee?"
    expected_answer: >
      The us-west region (which includes the Portland datacenter PDX-1) is
      covered by the Gold SLA tier. The Gold tier guarantees 99.95% uptime,
      which allows no more than 21.6 minutes of downtime per month.

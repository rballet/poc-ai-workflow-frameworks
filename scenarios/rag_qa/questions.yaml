questions:
  - id: q1
    text: "What is the GIL in Python and how does it affect concurrency?"
    expected_answer: >
      The GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) is a mutex in CPython that allows only
      one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time. This means CPU-bound
      tasks do not benefit from threading. For CPU-bound work, use
      multiprocessing instead. For I/O-bound work, threading and asyncio
      both work well because the GIL is released during I/O operations.

    text: "What is the difference between a 301 and a 302 HTTP redirect?"
    expected_answer: >
      A 301 is a permanent redirect, telling the client and search engines
      that the resource has permanently moved to a new URL. A 302 is a
      temporary redirect, meaning the original URL is still valid and the
      client should continue using it for future requests.

    text: "When should I use git rebase instead of git merge?"
    expected_answer: >
      Use rebase to keep a linear commit history, typically when updating a
      feature branch with changes from main. Use merge when you want to
      preserve the full branch history, especially for shared branches or
      pull requests. Never rebase commits that have been pushed to a shared
      branch.

    text: "Should I use threading or asyncio for making many HTTP requests in Python?"
    expected_answer: >
      Both work for I/O-bound tasks like HTTP requests, since the GIL is
      released during I/O. asyncio is generally preferred for high-concurrency
      I/O because it uses a single thread with an event loop, avoiding thread
      overhead. Threading is simpler for smaller-scale concurrent I/O.

    text: "What HTTP status code should a server return when a resource is not found?"
    expected_answer: >
      A 404 Not Found status code indicates that the server cannot find the
      requested resource. The URL may be wrong, or the resource may have been
      removed without a redirect.

    text: "Explain the GitHub Flow branching strategy."
    expected_answer: >
      GitHub Flow is a lightweight branching model: create a feature branch
      from main, make commits, open a pull request for review, and merge
      back to main after approval. Main is always deployable. It is simpler
      than Git Flow and well-suited for continuous deployment.

    text: "What are the tradeoffs between multiprocessing and asyncio in Python?"
    expected_answer: >
      Multiprocessing uses separate OS processes, bypasses the GIL, and is
      best for CPU-bound work, but has higher memory overhead and IPC
      complexity. asyncio uses a single thread with cooperative multitasking,
      is best for I/O-bound work, has low overhead, but requires async/await
      throughout the codebase.

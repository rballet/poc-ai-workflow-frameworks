    text: "What are the escalation triggers for promoting a sev2 incident to sev1?"
    expected_answer: |
      A Sev2 must be escalated to Sev1 if ANY of these are true:
      1. Cascading impact -- the affected service has downstream dependents also degraded
      2. Incident in "investigating" status for more than 60 minutes without identification
      3. Anomalous access patterns suggesting active exploitation (anomaly_score > 0.7)
      4. Explicit compliance or legal trigger (e.g., GDPR data exposure in EU region)

    text: "Was the most recent deploy of auth-service compliant with the change management policy?"
    expected_answer: |
      No, the auth-service deploy (DEP-102, image auth:v2.4.1-rc3) violated the change management policy:
      1. No change ticket was filed (change_ticket is NULL) -- all production deploys require a change ticket
      2. Auth-service is a critical tier service requiring 2 approvers, making the missing ticket a significant violation
      3. The deploy at 2026-02-10T16:30 UTC by bob@nimbusops.io triggered an incident (INC-4001) with a ~90 min rollback, exceeding the 15-minute rollback SLA for critical tier services

    text: "Was the firewall rule change FW-404 on prod-eu-west-1 properly authorized?"
    expected_answer: |
      No, FW-404 was not properly authorized. It violates the security compliance policy:
      1. Modified by bot-scanner@security-automation, but the rule opens port 8083 to an external CIDR (198.51.100.0/24), which is NOT a pre-approved template action
      2. Pre-approved templates are limited to blocking malicious IPs and rate-limiting -- opening ports to external CIDRs requires manual approval
      3. No change ticket is associated with this firewall change (the firewall_rules table has no ticket field and no corresponding CHG entry)

    text: "Which services have both open critical or high vulnerabilities and recent deploys without change tickets?"
    expected_answer: |
      No single service has both conditions simultaneously. Looking at each:
      - order-service (SVC-004) has an open critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-31337) but its recent deploy (DEP-104) HAS a change ticket (CHG-5495)
      - auth-service (SVC-002) has a recent deploy WITHOUT a change ticket (DEP-102, change_ticket is NULL) but its vulnerability (CVE-2025-28100, medium) is already mitigated
      - payment-service (SVC-003) has an open high vulnerability (CVE-2025-29555) and its deploy (DEP-103) HAS a change ticket (CHG-5480)
      So no service currently meets both criteria.

    text: "What is the likely root cause of INC-4001, and was proper incident response followed?"
    expected_answer: |
      Root cause: The auth-service deploy (v2.4.1-rc3, DEP-102) at 16:30 UTC introduced a latency regression (p99 latency 8200ms vs baseline 120ms). Since payment-service depends on auth-service synchronously, the auth-service latency caused payment-service to return 503 errors.

      Incident response assessment:
      - Commander assigned within 3 minutes (opened 17:15, commander at 17:18) -- COMPLIANT with 5-minute SLA
      - Identity team (auth-service owners) were NOT paged until 18:00 -- 45 minute delay. Per Sev1 runbook, ALL affected service owners must be paged immediately -- NON-COMPLIANT
      - The deploy itself violated change management policy: no change ticket was filed (required for all production deploys), and auth-service is critical tier requiring 2 approvers

      Rollback was initiated at 18:00 (confirmed by timeline entry TL-004).

    text: "Provide a full incident analysis for INC-4002: root cause, security posture assessment, and compliance violations."
    expected_answer: |
      INC-4002: order-service degraded performance in eu-west-1

      Root cause chain:
      1. Firewall rule FW-404 was modified at 12:00 UTC by bot-scanner@security-automation, opening port 8083 to 198.51.100.0/24
      2. Anomalous traffic from 198.51.100.x hit order-service starting at 14:05, with anomaly scores 0.85-0.95
      3. This traffic pattern caused order-service p95 latency to spike to 4500ms

      Security posture:
      - CVE-2025-31337 (critical, remote code execution) is OPEN on order-service and PAST its remediation deadline (was 2026-02-09)
      - The exposed port combined with an unpatched RCE vulnerability creates significant risk
      - Access logs show multiple high-anomaly requests, suggesting possible exploitation attempts

      Compliance violations:
      1. Firewall change by bot-scanner was NOT a pre-approved template action (opened external port, not just blocking/rate-limiting)
      2. No change ticket for the firewall modification
      3. Critical CVE past remediation deadline (24-hour SLA violated)
      4. EU region (eu-west-1) GDPR implications: order-service handles customer PII, potential data exposure must be reported to DPO within 24 hours

    text: "If we need to remediate INC-4002, what is the sequence of actions and who needs to approve?"
    expected_answer: |
      Recommended remediation sequence:

      1. IMMEDIATE: Revert firewall rule FW-404 to block external access to port 8083 on prod-eu-west-1
         - Requires: Security team approval (per firewall rule management policy)
         - The incident commander (Dave Wilson) must authorize as emergency change during investigation
         - Retroactive change ticket must be filed within 4 hours

      2. URGENT: Remediate CVE-2025-31337 on order-service
         - This is a critical RCE vulnerability past its 24-hour remediation deadline
         - Requires patching the container base image and redeploying
         - Deploy requires change ticket with 2 approvers (order-service is critical tier)
         - Commerce team (Dave Wilson primary, Irene Santos secondary) owns order-service

      3. REQUIRED: Notify the DPO of potential data exposure
         - EU region (eu-west-1) GDPR requirement
         - order-service handles customer PII
         - Notification must happen within 24 hours of detection

      4. FOLLOW-UP: Investigate the anomalous traffic from 198.51.100.0/24
         - Determine if the traffic was active exploitation or scanning
         - Review all data accessed during the exposure window (12:00-present)

    text: "Should INC-4002 be escalated from sev2 to sev1? Justify with evidence from the data and policies."
    expected_answer: |
      Yes, INC-4002 should be escalated to Sev1. Multiple escalation triggers are met:

      1. ANOMALOUS ACCESS (trigger 3): Access logs show multiple entries with anomaly_score > 0.7 (scores of 0.85, 0.91, 0.88, 0.95 from 198.51.100.x). The policy states anomaly_score > 0.7 triggers security review, and 3+ entries above 0.7 within 30 minutes triggers a security incident.

      2. CASCADING RISK (trigger 1): order-service has downstream dependents -- notification-service depends on it (async). If order-service degrades further, notification-service will also be affected.

      3. TIME THRESHOLD (trigger 2): INC-4002 was opened at 14:30 and as of the latest timeline entry (16:00) -- 90 minutes have passed and status is still "investigating" without identification. This exceeds the 60-minute threshold.

      4. GDPR COMPLIANCE (trigger 4): order-service is in eu-west-1 and handles customer PII. The combination of an unpatched critical RCE vulnerability and anomalous external traffic creates a potential data exposure, which is a compliance trigger.
